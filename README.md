## Overview
This program provides a set of flash cards that can be reviewed in the terminal. Upon start up, players are welcomed via the console. The player is presented with a question and three possible answers that can be toggled through using the arrow keys. Hit return on your answer to see if you're correct! At the end, a message denotes to the user their percentage of questions answered correctly.
